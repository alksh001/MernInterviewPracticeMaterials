Node js is single threaded for async processing, by doing so it can achieve more performance and scalability.



How single threaded model perform concurrency?

Node js processig is heavily influenced by js event based model and callback system, thus nodejs can easily 
achieve. Event- loop is responsible for maintaining the concurrency in nodejs


A callback is a function that is called after a given task, it allows other code to run in the meantime, 
and prevents blocking. It is passed as an argument to another functions. IT is commonly used to handle 
asynchronous ops such as reading files, making http requests, executing db queries etc.

Promises 


Advantages of using promises instead of callbacks

The logic of asynchronous is more specific and structured.
Built-in errors
Improved readibility.


Modules are like js libraries that can be used to include certain set of functions.
Some core modules are http, util, fs, stream etc.


Libraries in nodejs are
ExpressJs- It is nodejs web application framework that provides wide set of features 
Mongoose- This framework is used to connect web app to a db


Event loop handles async callbacks in nodejs.  it is the foundation of non-blocking I/O in nodejs.  


NextTick() postpones the execution of action untill the next pass around the event loop. or it simply calls the 
the callback once the loops current execution is completed.
setImmediate() executes a callback on next cycle of the event loop and returns the control to the event loop for a
any IO operations.


A Nodejs server never waits for an api to return data. Instead it moves to next API after calling an API and a 
notification mechanism from a Nodejs event responds to the previous API calls.
